 Agri-Energy Connect Prototype

This is a prototype web application built using ASP.NET Core MVC, designed to help farmers submit agricultural products and connect with green energy stakeholders. It features secure login, role-based access control, and real-time database interaction.



 🔧 Features

- ✅ Role-based authentication: Farmers and Employees have separate dashboards.
- ✅ Dynamic database interaction: No pre-seeded data — all records are added by users.
- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete products: Farmers can manage their own listings.
- ✅ Filter products: Employees can filter by date range and product type.
- ✅ Session-based security: Users must log in to access restricted areas.
- ✅ Responsive UI: Built with Bootstrap for consistent styling across devices.

 🛡️ Security Measures

- Session-based authentication using ASP.NET Core middleware
- Role-based access control enforced in base controller
- Input validation and error handling in all forms
- HTTPS enforcement in production mode



 🧪 Testing the Application

1. Start the app using `dotnet run`.
2. Open your browser and navigate to the homepage.
3. Log in with one of the default roles.
4. Farmers can add/edit/delete products.
5. Employees can view and filter all farmer products.



 📈 Future Improvements

- Replace in-memory database with SQL Server or PostgreSQL
- Implement external authentication (Google, Microsoft)
- Add unit and integration tests
- Deploy to Azure or AWS with CI/CD pipeline
- Integrate mobile-responsive design for field use
